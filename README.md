# Surfs Up Challenge Analysis
#flask, #SQLite, #SQLAlchemy #Python 

# Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to provide W.Avy more information about temperature trends for the months of June and December. The following informatiion is to support the investment that W.Avy want to contribute for the surf and ice cream shop. We'll be using SQLite to store the weather data that W. Avy shared with us and that we'll need for our analysis. With the following information, I wil be able to gather data to get the summarized statistcs for June and December. 

# Results

## Determine the Summary Statistics for June 

Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, I filtered the date column out of the Measurements table in the 'hawaii.sqlite' database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. In the Jupyter Notebook, I then converted those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

June's Temperature Stats:

## Determine the Summary Statistics for December
I repeated the same steps as followed for June's results. Except extracting the December Temps. Below are located December's temperature statistics.
